# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Feature-Based Module Organization

**Date**: 2024-12-XX
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

The codebase grew organically with mixed concerns in the `utils/` directory and unclear module boundaries. This made it difficult to understand dependencies and maintain code.

### Decision

Reorganize code using **feature-first architecture**:

- Group related functionality in `src/features/{feature}/`
- Shared business logic in `src/core/`
- Pure utilities only in `src/utils/`

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Clear module boundaries
- Easier to understand related functionality
- Better testability and maintainability
- Supports future microservice extraction

**Negative**:

- Large refactoring effort required
- Temporary increase in import path changes

## ADR-002: Path Aliases for Import Management

**Date**: 2024-12-XX  
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Deep relative imports (`../../../utils/something`) made code hard to read and refactor.

### Decision

Implement TypeScript path aliases:

- `@/` → `src/`
- `@features/*` → `src/features/*`
- `@core/*` → `src/core/*`
- `@utils/*` → `src/utils/*`

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Cleaner, more readable imports
- Easier refactoring and file moves
- IDE autocomplete works better

**Negative**:

- Requires build tool configuration
- Learning curve for new developers

## ADR-003: ESM-First with Jest Configuration

**Date**: 2024-12-XX
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Project uses ES modules but Jest configuration was complex with CJS/ESM mixing causing test failures.

### Decision

- Standardize on ESM throughout
- Configure Jest for native ESM support with ts-jest
- Use `@jest/globals` for test utilities

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Consistent module system
- Better tree-shaking
- Modern JavaScript practices
- Cleaner test configuration

**Negative**:

- Some legacy tooling compatibility issues
- Requires careful Jest configuration

## ADR-004: Strict TypeScript Configuration

**Date**: 2024-12-XX
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

TypeScript was configured with basic strict mode but missing some safety features.

### Decision

Enable additional strict TypeScript options:

- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `noUnusedLocals: true`
- `noUnusedParameters: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Better type safety
- Catches more errors at compile time
- Forces explicit typing

**Negative**:

- Requires more explicit type annotations
- May initially increase development time

---

## ADR-005: File Size Limits and Guidelines

**Date**: 2024-12-XX
**Status**: Accepted

### Context

Multiple files exceeded 400+ lines making them hard to understand and maintain.

### Decision

Establish size guidelines:

- Files: ≤400 lines (exceptions for generated code with header notes)
- Functions: ≤60 lines
- Classes: ≤200 lines

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- More focused, readable code
- Better testability
- Easier code review

**Negative**:

- Requires disciplined refactoring
- May increase number of files

---

_Future ADRs will be added as architectural decisions are made during the refactoring process._
